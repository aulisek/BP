Most of the newly discovered active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are poorly water soluble in crystalline forms, which limit their bioavailability, dissolution, and then their distribution through the organism. This fact limits its wider oral use as a solid drug in medical treatment. Today, combinatorial chemistry techniques and high-throughput screening have led to a sharp increase in the quantity of nonsoluble API molecules, so the oral administration of poorly soluble drugs has become the biggest challenge for formulation scientists in the pharmaceutical industry. \cite{leuner_improving_2000} There are different strategies to overcome this issue, such as cocrystal formation \cite{batisai_solubility_2021}, conversion of API to its salt \cite{huang_impact_2004} or using solid dispersion. \cite{srinarong_improved_2011} 

In 1961, Sekiguchi and Obi provided the earliest account of the so-called first-generation solid dispersion, when they discovered that the creation of eutectic mixtures enhances the rate of drug release and bioavailability. First-generation solid dispersions were built from crystalline carriers such as urea or sugars, forming crystalline solid dispersions. The second generation solid dispersion was replacing crystalline carriers by amorphous carriers such as polymers, forming an amorphous product in which crystalline API is dissolved. There exist also a third generation of solid dispersion using a surfactant carrier or a combination of amorphous polymers and surfactants.~\cite{vasconcelos_solid_2007}

Our aim is to overcome the poor solubility by using amorphous solid phases of APIs and to avert the rearrangement of molecules into a crystal lattice. However, crystalline forms of APIs are advantageous because of their better stability during long-term storage and better predictions of changes at the molecular level under defined conditions, so the use of crystalline forms limits the bioavailibility. \cite{caron_comparison_2011} The better solubility of APIs in amorphous forms comes from a higher Gibbs energy in the amorphous form compared to the crystalline forms. During processing, storage, and after contact with water or humidity, the thermodynamically metastable amorphous forms tend to crystallise. Solid mixtures of API and excipients (e.g. polymeric excipients) create amorphous solid dispersions (ASD) and offer a way to inhibit crystallisation of the API before and after oral administration of the dose. \cite{prudic_thermodynamic_2014}

The addition of an excipient to an amorphous API can generally have a twofold effect on the rate of solid-state crystallisation, affecting both thermodynamic and kinetic aspects. Thermodynamically, it reduces the Gibbs energy due to strong intermolecular interactions between API and its excipient, as well as it increases kinetic barriers to recrystallisation. On the atomic scale of individual interactions, hydrogen bonding makes the most contribution. \cite{newman_what_2022}

\subsection{Studied compounds}
\subsubsection{Polylactic acid}
Polylactic acid (PLA) was chosen as a biocompatible polymer excipient.  PLA is a biodegradable polymer formed by the polymerisation of lactic acid. The formula of the PLA monomer unit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pla}. In this work, two condensed units of D-PLA were considered as the simplest building block for creating all of the other longer polymer chains. Polymer samples of a length of 100 dimer units were created by replicating these dimer units. The molar weight of our dimer unit considered in the investigation (two polymerised lactic acid chains) is $M_\mathrm{w}$~=162.14~$\mathrm{g \cdot mol^{-1}}$, which means that the polymer chain used in the simulations has a molar weight equal to  $M_\mathrm{w}$~=14~431~$\mathrm{g \cdot mol^{-1}}$. Other suitable biocompatible and biodegradable polymers for ASD could be polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). \cite{klajmon_glass_2023}

\subsubsection{Active pharmaceutical ingredients}

%\subsubsection{Ibuprofen}
The first selected API is \textbf{ibuprofen}, systematically 2-(4-Isobutylphenyl)propanoic acid (C$_{13}$H$_{18}$O$_{2}$) as an example of a widely used analgesic-antipyretic-antiflammator drug. The racemic mixture is commonly used in medical treatment, whereas the S- enantiomer has stronger pharmaceutical activity than the R- enantiomer, which is metabolically transformed to S- in the organism. \cite{rainsford_ibuprofen_2009} In this work the S- form, which is visualised in Figure \ref{fig:APIs}, is used. The molar weight is $M_\mathrm{w}$~=~206.28~$\mathrm{g\ mol^{-1}}$ and the melting point is 324.4 K. \cite{stejfa_heat_2021} 

%\subsubsection{Naproxen}
The second selected API is \textbf{naproxen}, systematically 2-(6-Methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)propanoic acid (C$_{14}$H$_{14}$O$_{3}$), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, used as a painkiller. Naproxen contains three oxygen atoms (one carboxyl group and one ether bond), the structure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:APIs} in the upper right corner. On the basis of its structure, naproxen can donate one hydrogen bond and accept up to three hydrogen bonds. Naproxen is a white crystalline powder, with a molar weight of $M_\mathrm{w}$~=~230.263~$\mathrm{g\ mol^{-1}}$ and melting point 429.3 K. \cite{stejfa_heat_2021}

%\subsubsection{Carbamazepine}
\textbf{Carbamazepine}, alternatively 5-Carbamoyl-5H-dibenzo(b,f)azepine (C$_{15}$H$_{12}$N$_{2}$O) is a representative anticonvulsant, which is used for the treatment of seizures and neuropathic pain. Carbamazepine contains two nitrogen atoms (amide group) and one oxygen in the carboxyl group; its structure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:APIs} on the left side. According to its structure, carbamazepine can accept and donate one hydrogen bond. Carbamazepine is a white crystalline powder, with a molar weight of $M_\mathrm{w}$~=~236.273~$\mathrm{g\ mol^{-1}}$ and melting temperature of 463.6 K. \cite{stejfa_heat_2021}

%\subsubsection{Indomethacine}
\textbf{indomethacin}, 2-{1-[(4-Chlorophenyl)carbonyl]-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl}acetic acid (C$_{19}$H$_{16}$ClNO$_{4}$), which structure is in Figure \ref{fig:APIs}, is used in the treatment of musculoskeletal and joint disorders. The molar weight is $M_\mathrm{w}$~=~357.8~$\mathrm{g\ mol^{-1}}$ and the melting temperature is 433.3 K. \cite{stejfa_heat_2021}

%\subsubsection{Sulfathiazole}
The last selected API was \textbf{sulfathiazole} with systematic name 4-amino-N-thiazol-2-ylidenebenzene-sulfonamide as a representative antibiotic drug from the sulfonamides group, which is used in the treatment of pyogenic cutaneous infections. Sulfathiazole is a white crystalline powder, with a molar weight $(M_\mathrm{w})$ =255.3 $\mathrm{gmol^{-1}}$, which is highly polymorphic, five polymorphs have been discovered so far \cite{caron_comparison_2011}. All known polymorphs of sulfathiazole crystallise in the $P2_1/c$ space group, but there are differences in intermolecular bonding and structural properties \cite{drebushchak_crystal_2008}. The II polymorph structure, shown in Figure \ref{fig:sulfathiazole}, is used in this work. There are four molecules of sulfathiazole in the crystal monoclinic unit cell.
