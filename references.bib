@article{cervinka_structure_2021,
	abstract = {Glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important material property, which predetermines the kinetic stability of amorphous solids. In the context of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), there is motivation to maximize their Tg by forming amorphous mixtures with other chemicals, labeled excipients. Molecular dynamics simulations are a natural computational tool to investigate the relationships between structure, dynamics, and cohesion of amorphous materials with an all-atom resolution. This work presents a computational study, addressing primarily the predictions of the glass transition temperatures of four selected API (carbamazepine, racemic ibuprofen, indomethacin, and naproxen) with two nucleobases (adenine and cytosine). Since the classical non-polarizable simulations fail to reach the quantitative accuracy of the predicted Tg, analyses of internal dynamics, hydrogen bonding, and cohesive forces in bulk phases of pure API and their mixtures with the nucleobases are performed to interpret the predicted trends. This manuscript reveals the method for a systematic search of beneficial pairs of API and excipients (with maximum Tg when mixed). Monitoring of transport and cohesive properties of API–excipients systems via molecular simulation will enable the design of such API formulations more efficiently in the future.},

@article{newman_what_2022,
	abstract = {In this Perspective, the authors examine the various factors that should be considered when attempting to use miscible amorphous API-excipient mixtures  (amorphous solid dispersions and coamorphous systems) to prevent the solid-state  crystallization of API molecules when isothermally stored for long periods of  time (a year or more) in the glassy state. After presenting an overview of a  variety of studies designed to obtain a better understanding of possible  mechanisms by which amorphous API undergo physical instability and by which  excipients generally appear to inhibit API crystallization from the amorphous  state, we examined 78 studies that reported acceptable physical stability of such  systems, stored below T(g) under "dry" conditions for one year or more. These  results were examined more closely in terms of two major contributing factors:  the degree to which a reduction in diffusional molecular mobility and  API-excipient molecular interactions operates to inhibit crystallization. These  two parameters were chosen because the data are readily available in early  development to help compare amorphous systems. Since T(g) - T = 50 K is often  used as a rule of thumb for the establishing the minimum value below T(g)  required to reduce diffusional mobility to a period of years, it was interesting  to observe that 30 of the 78 studies still produced significant physical  stability at values of T(g) - T {\textless} 50 K (3-47 °C), suggesting that factors besides  diffusive molecular mobility likely contribute. A closer look at the T(g) - T {\textless}  50 systems shows that hydrogen bonding, proton transfer, disruption of API-API  self-associations (such as dimers), and possible \ensuremath{\pi}-\ensuremath{\pi} stacking were reported for  most of the systems. In contrast, five crystallized systems that were monitored  for a year or more were also examined. These systems exhibited T(g) - T values of  9-79, with three of them exhibiting T(g) - T {\textless} 50. For these three samples, none  displayed molecular interactions by infrared spectroscopy. A discussion on the  impact of relative humidity on long-term crystallization in the glass was  included, with attention paid to the relative water vapor sorption by various  excipients and effects on diffusive mobility and molecular interactions between  API and excipient.},

              Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three‐dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double‐layers, etc. The packing time for state‐of‐the‐art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files. The package is distributed as free software and can be downloaded from

	abstract = {Abstract
            CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model‐building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many‐particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical‐molecular mechanical force fields, to all‐atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.J Comput Chem, 2009.},

            Empirical force field‐based studies of biological macromolecules are becoming a common tool for investigating their structure–activity relationships at an atomic level of detail. Such studies facilitate interpretation of experimental data and allow for information not readily accessible to experimental methods to be obtained. A large part of the success of empirical force field‐based methods is the quality of the force fields combined with the algorithmic advances that allow for more accurate reproduction of experimental observables. Presented is an overview of the issues associated with the development and application of empirical force fields to biomolecular systems. This is followed by a summary of the force fields commonly applied to the different classes of biomolecules; proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. In addition, issues associated with computational studies on “heterogeneous” biomolecular systems and the transferability of force fields to a wide range of organic molecules of pharmacological interest are discussed. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

              An improved method for computing potential‐derived charges is described which is based upon the CHELP program available from QCPE.
              1
              This approach (CHELPG) is shown to be considerably less dependent upon molecular orientation than the original CHELP program. In the second part of this work, the CHELPG point selection algorithm was used to analyze the changes in the potential‐derived charges in formamide during rotation about the CN bond. In order to achieve a level of rotational invariance less than 10\% of the magnitude of the electronic effects studied, an equally‐spaced array of points 0.3 Å apart was required. Points found to be greater than 2.8 Å from any nucleus were eliminated, along with all points contained within the defined VDW distances from each of the atoms. The results are compared to those obtained by using CHELP. Even when large numbers of points (ca. 3000) were sampled using the CHELP selection routine, the results did not indicate a satisfactory level of rotatational invariance. On the basis of these results, the original CHELP program was found to be inadequate for analyzing internal rotations.},
