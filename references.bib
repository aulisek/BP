@article{cervinka_structure_2021,
	abstract = {Glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important material property, which predetermines the kinetic stability of amorphous solids. In the context of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), there is motivation to maximize their Tg by forming amorphous mixtures with other chemicals, labeled excipients. Molecular dynamics simulations are a natural computational tool to investigate the relationships between structure, dynamics, and cohesion of amorphous materials with an all-atom resolution. This work presents a computational study, addressing primarily the predictions of the glass transition temperatures of four selected API (carbamazepine, racemic ibuprofen, indomethacin, and naproxen) with two nucleobases (adenine and cytosine). Since the classical non-polarizable simulations fail to reach the quantitative accuracy of the predicted Tg, analyses of internal dynamics, hydrogen bonding, and cohesive forces in bulk phases of pure API and their mixtures with the nucleobases are performed to interpret the predicted trends. This manuscript reveals the method for a systematic search of beneficial pairs of API and excipients (with maximum Tg when mixed). Monitoring of transport and cohesive properties of API–excipients systems via molecular simulation will enable the design of such API formulations more efficiently in the future.},

@article{newman_what_2022,
	abstract = {In this Perspective, the authors examine the various factors that should be considered when attempting to use miscible amorphous API-excipient mixtures  (amorphous solid dispersions and coamorphous systems) to prevent the solid-state  crystallization of API molecules when isothermally stored for long periods of  time (a year or more) in the glassy state. After presenting an overview of a  variety of studies designed to obtain a better understanding of possible  mechanisms by which amorphous API undergo physical instability and by which  excipients generally appear to inhibit API crystallization from the amorphous  state, we examined 78 studies that reported acceptable physical stability of such  systems, stored below T(g) under "dry" conditions for one year or more. These  results were examined more closely in terms of two major contributing factors:  the degree to which a reduction in diffusional molecular mobility and  API-excipient molecular interactions operates to inhibit crystallization. These  two parameters were chosen because the data are readily available in early  development to help compare amorphous systems. Since T(g) - T = 50 K is often  used as a rule of thumb for the establishing the minimum value below T(g)  required to reduce diffusional mobility to a period of years, it was interesting  to observe that 30 of the 78 studies still produced significant physical  stability at values of T(g) - T {\textless} 50 K (3-47 °C), suggesting that factors besides  diffusive molecular mobility likely contribute. A closer look at the T(g) - T {\textless}  50 systems shows that hydrogen bonding, proton transfer, disruption of API-API  self-associations (such as dimers), and possible \ensuremath{\pi}-\ensuremath{\pi} stacking were reported for  most of the systems. In contrast, five crystallized systems that were monitored  for a year or more were also examined. These systems exhibited T(g) - T values of  9-79, with three of them exhibiting T(g) - T {\textless} 50. For these three samples, none  displayed molecular interactions by infrared spectroscopy. A discussion on the  impact of relative humidity on long-term crystallization in the glass was  included, with attention paid to the relative water vapor sorption by various  excipients and effects on diffusive mobility and molecular interactions between  API and excipient.},
